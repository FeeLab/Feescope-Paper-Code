# Feescope-Paper-Code
Analysis code used to process data and generate figures in the paper "A Novel Optical Design Enabling Lightweight and Large Field-of-View Head-Mounted Microscopes" from the Fee Lab at MIT. A preprint is accessible [here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.09.03.458947v2).

Some of the analysis code relies on raw data and from saved outputs from intermediate processing steps. These outputs are assumed to be located at `Feescope-Paper-Code/raw_data` and `Feescope-Paper-Code/supporting_data`, respectively. These folders are too large to upload to GitHub, but they can be downloaded [here](https://www.academictorrents.com) and copied into your local version of the repository.
